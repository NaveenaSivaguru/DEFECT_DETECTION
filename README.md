# Hackathon 2025 - Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains solutions for the Hackathon 2025 conducted by **Dhvani AI**. The hackathon challenges participants to develop computer vision algorithms using deep learning and classical methods, focusing on practical scenarios and constraints.

## Overview

The hackathon included three main tasks:

1. **Defect Detection**  
   Develop an algorithm to detect defects in images with varying conditions such as size and translation. The solution includes defect localization and classification into types like flashes and cut marks.

2. **Dynamic System Simulation**  
   Implement a program to simulate and plot the trajectory of a dynamical system in 3D space, modeled as a bee moving according to given differential equations.

3. **Vehicle Detection and Classification**  
   Create an object detection and classification model to identify vehicle types (car, bus, motorbike, rickshaw) from images with XML annotations. Includes dataset exploration, annotation conversion, model training using YOLOv8, and evaluation.
